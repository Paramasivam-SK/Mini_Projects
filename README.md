## 🚍 Bus Reservation System (C with Data Structures)

### 🔧 Technologies Used:
- Language: **C**
- Concepts: **Structures**, **Linked Lists**, **File Handling**, **Queues/Stacks**

### 📌 Description:
A console-based bus reservation system that allows users to:
- View available buses
- Book tickets
- Cancel reservations
- View seat availability

The project efficiently utilizes data structures such as **linked lists** and **arrays** to manage bus data, booking information, and user inputs.

### 📁 Features:
- Admin and user modes
- Dynamic seat allocation
- Simple user interface via terminal
- File storage for persistent booking data

## 🎯 Color Tracking Using MATLAB

### 🔧 Tools Used:
- **MATLAB**
- **Image Processing Toolbox**

### 📌 Description:
A color tracking project that detects and follows specific colored objects in real-time using a webcam or pre-recorded video.

It uses:
- RGB to HSV color conversion
- Thresholding based on color range
- Morphological operations to reduce noise
- Bounding boxes to highlight tracked objects

### 📁 Features:
- Real-time object tracking
- Adjustable color threshold
- Option to use live camera feed or video file
- Visualization with bounding boxes

### 📷 Sample Application:
- Track a red-colored ball across a frame
- Useful for gesture recognition or robotic vision
